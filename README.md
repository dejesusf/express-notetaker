# Express Notetaker

## Description
With the use of the npm package, Express, wer're able to create an application that the user may use to create, save, and delete notes. Learning to use express was pretty complex. There were concepts that took a while to understand but overall, I was glad to make this application work! A lot of the routing is very similar so that helped a lot.
